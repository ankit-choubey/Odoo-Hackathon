# Enhancer Module

This module provides a **Prompt Enhancer** service leveraging a pretrained Transformer-based language model (such as T5). The enhancer takes a raw, messy, or unstructured input prompt and generates a cleaner, more coherent, and contextually improved version of the prompt. It is useful for refining user queries before feeding them into downstream AI models or pipelines.

## Features

- Uses a state-of-the-art pretrained sequence-to-sequence Transformer model for text enhancement.
- Simplifies and restructures prompts for better model understanding.
- Easy integration into existing ML pipelines.
- Lightweight and efficient, suitable for quick prompt refinement.

- ## Usage

### CLI Usage

You can run the enhancer from the command line by editing the `enhance.py` script to accept command-line arguments or by modifying the prompt inside the script directly.



```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
