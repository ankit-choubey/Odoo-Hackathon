# Sentimental Analyser

This module provides a sentiment analysis service using a pretrained machine learning model. It classifies input text into sentiment categories such as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.

## üîç Features

- Text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, etc.)
- Pretrained sentiment classification model
- API-ready structure for backend integration
- Easy-to-extend for multilingual or domain-specific sentiment tasks

## üß† Model

This service uses a pretrained transformer-based model (like `distilBERT`) or custom-trained model for sentiment classification. The model is loaded and used through PyTorch or Hugging Face Transformers.
