The Roman Empire was one of the most influential civilizations in history. It began as a small city-state in Italy and eventually expanded to dominate much of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. The empire contributed to the development of architecture, law, language, and government. Despite its strengths, the Roman Empire faced internal conflicts, economic difficulties, and invasions that eventually led to its decline. The Western Roman Empire officially fell in 476 AD, but its legacy continues to shape modern society.
